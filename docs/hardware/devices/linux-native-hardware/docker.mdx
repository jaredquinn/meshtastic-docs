If you do not own a Linux machine, or you just want to separate things, you might want
to run the application inside a docker container.

## Installing from Dockerhub


## Building a Docker container

To build docker image, type

`docker build -t meshtastic/device .`


To run a container, type

`docker run --rm -p 4403:4403 meshtastic/device`

or, to get an interactive shell on the docker created container:

`docker run -it -p 4403:4403 meshtastic/device bash`

You might want to mount your local development folder:


`docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=/PathToMyProjects/Meshtastic/Meshtastic-device-mybranch,target=/Meshtastic-device-mybranch -p 4403:4403 meshtastic/device bash`

### Stop the container

Run this to get the ID:

`docker ps`

Stop the container with command:

`docker kill <id>`

> Tip: you can just use the first few characters of the ID in docker commands
