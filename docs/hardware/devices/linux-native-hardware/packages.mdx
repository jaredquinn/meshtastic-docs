description: Set up Meshtastic on Linux-native devices using the meshtasticd binary or OS packages.
---

This page outlines the setup of Meshtastic on Linux-native devices direcly on the operating system either installing the released packages or building from source yourself.

## Install from Packages


- Necessary system libraries should be installed before building or installing Meshtastic.

```shell
sudo apt install libgpiod libyaml-cpp0.7 libbluetooth
```

- And optionally for web server support
```shell
sudo apt install openssl libssl libulfius liborcania
```

- The .deb Package is available as part of the release, installing the binary, a systemd service, and a config file. It is compiled for Debian Bookworm and incompatible with Bullseye.

```shell
sudo apt install ./meshtasticd_{version}arm64.deb
```

## Build from Source

### Install the -dev packages for dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install libgpiod-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libbluetooth-dev
```

- And optionally for web server support

```shell
sudo apt install openssl libssl-dev libulfius-dev liborcania-dev
```


First, some environment variables need to be set up with command:

`. ~/.platformio/penv/bin/activate`

You can build amd64 image with command

`./bin/build-native.sh`

### Executing the application interactively

The built binary file should be found under name
`release/latest/bins/universal/meshtastic_linux_amd64`.
If this is not the case, you can also use the direct program name:
`.pio/build/native/program`
